## Description

This project is a todo list application built with Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. The application allows users to create and manage a list of tasks, including adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks.

Users can view their entire task list on the main page of the application, and can filter the list to show only active or completed tasks. The application uses a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to quickly add and manage their tasks.

This project was developed as a technical challenge for the company called Iris. It is designed to demonstrate the developer's skills and abilities in building web applications using Angular.

## Branching Strategy

I use the following branching strategy for this project:

- `main`: This branch contains the latest stable version of the code. I only merge fully tested and reviewed code into this branch.
- `develop`: This branch is used for active development. I merge all pull requests into this branch, and then periodically merge it into `master` when I have a stable release.
- `feature/*`: For each new feature I am working on, I create a new branch off of `development` with a name like `feature/my-feature`. When the feature is complete, I open a pull request to merge it back into `development`.

## Code Documentation

I try to include thorough documentation in the form of comments and docstrings within the code itself to explain how the different parts of the project work together.
I hope this example gives you an idea of how you can document the development process of your project in a README.md file. Let me know if you have any other questions!
